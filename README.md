# ecoflux

WIP!

This is a collection of tools written in python and R that can be used for calculating ecosystem fluxes (CO2, H2O, etc), unit and measurement conversions, statistical analysis (uncertainty, etc), and plotting with environmental data. These have been collected and adapted from various sources and all operations should have appropriate references (in docstrings).
